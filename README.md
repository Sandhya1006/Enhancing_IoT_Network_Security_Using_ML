# 🌐 Enhancing IOT Network security using Machine Learning

🚀 **Enhancing-IOT-Network-security-using-Machine-Learning** is a practical project focused on **network traffic analysis in IoT environments**.  
It demonstrates how data science techniques can be used to **analyze, preprocess, and classify network traffic** generated by IoT devices.

This repository is designed to be **easy to understand**, **easy to run**, and **easy to extend**.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

- Analyze **IoT network traffic data**
- Apply **data preprocessing & feature engineering**
- Train **machine learning models** to understand traffic behavior
- Evaluate models using **clear performance metrics**
- Provide a **foundation for security, anomaly detection, or traffic classification**

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

IoT networks are:
- Highly distributed
- Resource-constrained
- Vulnerable to abnormal traffic patterns

Understanding IoT network traffic helps in:
- 📊 Traffic classification
- 🔍 Pattern discovery
- 🛡️ Security monitoring (supporting use-cases)
- ⚙️ Network optimization

> ⚠️ Note:  
> This project focuses on **network analysis & ML**.  
> It can **support cybersecurity use cases**, but it is **not limited to security only**.
